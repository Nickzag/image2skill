# image2skill

Reusable image-generation skills from the image2skill gallery.

image2skill turns selected generated works into compact prompt skills: each skill captures the visual grammar, subject structure, composition rules, and reusable prompt templates behind a consistent image style.

## How to use a skill

1. Open a skill folder.
2. Read `SKILL.md` for the visual grammar and prompt assembly notes.
3. Start from `prompts/base.md`.
4. Replace the bracketed variables with your subject, scene, palette, pose, and constraints.
5. Use `examples.md` and `prompts/variants.md` as starting points for variations.

Example:

```text
Use skills/editorial-poster/SKILL.md.
Subject: community coffee-grounds recycling booth.
Output: one vertical white-paper editorial poster prompt with meaningful coffee-recycling objects only.
```

## Skill format

Each skill follows the same structure:

- `SKILL.md`: purpose, use cases, visual grammar, prompt template, variables, and quality notes.
- `examples.md`: finished prompt examples.
- `prompts/base.md`: a reusable base prompt.
- `prompts/variants.md`: optional prompt variations.
